This is how you can add videos with thumbnails to notes in Obsidian:

```html
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/...." width="560" height="315" title="A YouTube Video" frameboarder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```

This comes from the [Classy Nemesis](https://classynemesis.com/projects/ytembed/) website
